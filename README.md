# Waste-Classification-Neural-Network

For the APS360 final project, my team and I explored two neural network architectures (our own Convolutional Neural Network and an AlexNet) that can predict the waste
disposal category that any given input image of a waste item belongs to. In the final report, we reiterate our rationale for this project, highlight some similar existing
work in the field, explain our data split and processing, explain our architectures, explain our baseline model, summarize our results, evaluate our model on new data, 
and discuss takeaways, ethical dilemmas and our projectâ€™s difficulty level for this course.

A short 7 minute video briefly goes over our project:
